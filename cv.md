### About Me:
As a graduate in computational physics, I have a solid foundation in mathematics, physics and computer science. During my studies, I was able to deepen my programming skills in languages such as C++ and develop a broad understanding of complex systems. My professional experience in web development and online marketing has further developed my skills and strengthened my understanding of the importance of user-friendly, aesthetically pleasing front-end design. I have gained extensive experience working with content management systems such as Wordpress, Joomla and Opencart and have mastered building websites from scratch as well as managing and updating existing websites. I have also completed additional training in front-end development to keep my knowledge and skills up to date. I am familiar with the current trends and technologies in web design and can easily work within an existing code to meet the requirements and goals of the project.

### Code example:
One of my recent code writing efforts is a program that predicts the population size of organisms from day one to day n (inclusive). The program outputs the day number followed by a space and then the population size on that day. Three natural numbers 𝑚 , 𝑝 , 𝑛 are given as input to the program.
* m: initial number of organisms; 
* p: average daily growth rate in %; 
* n: number of days for reproduction. 

```m, p, n = int(input()), int(input()), int(input())
for i in range(n):
    print(i + 1, m * (p / 100 + 1) ** i)
```
