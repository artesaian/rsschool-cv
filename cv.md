### About Me:
>As a graduate in computational physics, I have a solid foundation in mathematics, physics and computer science. During my studies, I was able to deepen my programming skills in languages such as C++ and develop a broad understanding of complex systems. My professional experience in web development and online marketing has further developed my skills and strengthened my understanding of the importance of user-friendly, aesthetically pleasing front-end design. I have gained extensive experience working with content management systems such as Wordpress, Joomla and Opencart and have mastered building websites from scratch as well as managing and updating existing websites. I have also completed additional training in front-end development to keep my knowledge and skills up to date. I am familiar with the current trends and technologies in web design and can easily work within an existing code to meet the requirements and goals of the project.
